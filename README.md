# Introduction-Application
An unfinished introduction application to myself to both introduce myself and display my knowledge of different android implementations and concepts

Currently implemented:

-Screen sliding via a viewpager.

-A user and password text box

-A 'register' button that displays a display fragment.

-A 'confirm' button in the register display fragment that enters user and password information

-A database created in Android Studio.

Currently to do:

-Check existing users when the 'Log in' button is pressed.

-Implement other interesting Android features (not yet decided).
